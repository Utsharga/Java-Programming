To compute fibonacci(8), 
the program first computes fibonacchi(7) and fibonacci(6)
which recursively evaluates fibonacchi(n-1) and fibonacchi(n-2)
for both the fibonacchi of 7 and 6. With each recursion,
two more sequences are evaluated, which becomes really redundant.
It comes up to be a really long runtime approximately Fn for fibonacchi(n).

Example:
fibonacci(8)
	fibonacci(7)
		fibonacci(6)
			fibonacci(5)
				fibonacci(4)
					fibonacci(3)
						fibonacci(2)
							fibonacci(1)
								return 0
							return 1
						.
						.
						.
						.
						.
						.
						.
						.
	return 21
